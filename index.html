							<h2>World Happiness Data Analysis (2015-2023) - Microsoft Power BI Dashboard</h2>
							<p>Performed an in-depth analysis of the World Happiness Report data from 2015 to 2023 using Power BI. The project involved integrating and normalizing complex datasets to reveal global happiness trends and factors affecting well-being. Key features included interactive dashboards that offered insights into average happiness scores by year, region, and country, as well as correlations with GDP, health, freedom, family support, generosity, and trust. Challenges such as data inconsistencies were addressed through rigorous data cleaning, transformation, and validation. This project enhanced my skills in data visualization, Power BI, and dynamic data exploration, and deepened my understanding of global happiness metrics.</p>

								Spam Message Detector Web Application using Natural Language Processing in Python</h2>
							<p>For my final year project, I developed a spam email categorization system using Python, which significantly advanced my skills in natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and data visualization. utilizing essential libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and scikit learn, the project involved comprehensive data cleaning (text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, lemmatization, and duplication management), visualization and model building. I implemented a Multinomial Naive Bayes model for text classification, chosen for its suitability to the dataset’s characteristics. To provide a user-friendly interface, I built a Streamlit web application that facilitates interaction with the spam classifier. This project not only refined my Python programming and NLP skills but also highlighted the importance of effective data preparation in machine learning in regards to text data.</p>

							<h2>Computer Vision: Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning Predictive Models in Python</h2>
							<p>In a collaborative group project involving three members, we focused on applying deep learning models such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for image classification, with a potential application in medical diagnostics for brain tumors. Our approach began with defining the problem statement: enhancing image classification accuracy, especially in medical imaging contexts. We utilized a labeled dataset with "yes" and "no" classifications to train our models effectively. The project involved extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and augmentation techniques to prepare the dataset. We constructed various models, including those utilizing transfer learning with VGG16, to optimize classification performance. Model evaluation focused on accuracy, precision, and computational efficiency. The project aims to improve the classification of brain MRI images for earlier and more accurate diagnoses, contributing valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of different neural network architectures.</p>

								Student Academic Performance Analysis using R</h2>
							<p>This project scrutinized student academic performance by analyzing a dataset with attributes such as gender, school, family background, and alcohol consumption. The objective was to uncover how these factors relate to academic success. Key features of the project include Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involving visualization of data to identify patterns as well as statistical analyses to explore various factors like gender differences in grades, the impact of different schools on performance, the effect of alcohol consumption on final grades, the influence of romantic relationships on grades and attendance, and the role of travel time in academic success. Tools used include R and RStudio for data analysis, with packages like tidyverse for data manipulation and gridExtra for advanced plotting. Results were communicated through effective visualizations such as box and violin plots.</p>

								Healthcare Data Analysis and Dynamic Dashboard in Excel</h2>
								<p>Conducted a comprehensive analysis of a healthcare dataset using Excel. Steps included utilizing Power Query to clean and transform the data, addressing inconsistencies and adding custom columns to ensure its accuracy and reliability. For advanced analysis, PivotTables and charts, leveraging DAX formulas were implemented to reveal meaningful trends and insights. A dynamic dashboard featuring pivot charts and slicers was created to facilitate quick decision-making and interactive data exploration. Additionally, I used conditional formatting to highlight critical metrics and emphasize key data-driven insights. While the dataset was synthetically generated using Python's Faker library, which introduced some limitations in real-world patterns, the project provided a valuable opportunity to refine my technical skills. Overall, this experience not only improved my analytical capabilities but also offered significant insights into patient care trends and operational efficiencies.</p>
